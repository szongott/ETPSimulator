# ETPSimulator

This simulator has been developed to analyze the threats and possible countermeasures against evil twin access points. It was used to simulate different training, learning and recognition algorithms in order to find a context-based and self-contained solution.

It is also part of a publication for the 19th International Conference on Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2015.
